<p>
    <b>I'm Tambon Tamang:</b> a web developer with a unique journey. I dedicated 8 years to military service before embarking on a career change. My passion for web development led me to start my learning journey through YouTube tutorials. However, my thirst for knowledge pushed me to enroll in an accredited web development course on Udemy.

    This project represents my first step into the coding cosmos, and I'm driven to explore its infinite possibilities. My military background has instilled discipline, resilience, and attention to detail in me, qualities that I bring to my web development work. I'm excited to leverage my skills and newfound expertise to create innovative and user-friendly websites, contributing to the ever-evolving digital landscape. The transition from military service to web development may seem unconventional, but it underscores my determination to excel in this dynamic field.
